NestCheck
=======================

## Synopsis

###Buying a house?

Have you ever arrived at a property viewing and not really known what you should be looking for or what questions you SHOULD be asking (why they chose THAT colour scheme is not a valid question).

You never need to go to a property viewing unprepared again! This program allows the user to quickly look through some tips on what to look for and why it's relevant.

## Job List

- [x] Allows user to enter their name / displays welcome message
- [x] Allows user to select property type
- [x] Displays list of rooms/areas relevant to property type
- [x] Displays tips relevant to each room/area when clicked
- [x] Displays further information for each tip when clicked
- [x] Allows user to enter the postcode of the property to display it on an integrated google map

## Still to complete/refactor

- [ ] Interface.js could benefit from further refactoring

## Takeaway

- I learnt how to use Ajax and JSON data following Jon Duckett's JavaScript & JQuery book. I followed a tutorial from this book to create the room list, tips and details section.
- I experimented with the Google Maps API.
- This project enabled me to take a further look into what can be achieved with JQuery.
- I was able to make the program into a one page site that moves you to the next area on click.
- Clearly label what is going on in the JQuery file and refactor as you go along, otherwise things get pretty ugly, pretty quickly!
